# French Quarter Festival Redesign

This is my final project for the UI Design course at The Iron Yard. It is a redesign for The French Quarter Festival website.
We were given two weeks to complete this project, from research and discovery to final live coded website. 
Technologies and skills used include HTML, SASS, Bourbon, CSS3 animations and transitions, Reset.scss, Modernizr.js, Responsive Web Design, 
Js plugin, Photoshop (wireframing, comps, and styletiles), Illustrator (icon set and logos), sketching, research, site and competitor analysis, and Typekit.
